        are the attribute names and the values are the entity field values.
        The only permitted key is the id - which is also required.

        self.session.delete(entity)

        Remember that all to-many relationships will be followed so, in this case,

        Write (create or update) ICAT entities from nested lists and dicts.

        If there are multiple top level entities to be handled then the argument
        passed in must be a list. Each top level entity is represented by a dict with a
        key of the entity name and a value which is a dict where the keys are the
        attribute names and the values are the entity field values.

        A list of the ids of the top level entities created is returned.

        A simple example which will create a single Facility and return its id is:

        facility = {}
        facility["name"] = "Test Facility"
        entity = {"Facility":facility}
        fid = session.write(entity)[0]

        or in one line:

        fid = session.write({"Facility":{"name":Test Facility}})

        If the attribute is a many to one relationship then the value is a dict and if it
        is a one to many relationship then the value is a list of dicts.

        For example to create a dataset referencing the already existing Investigation
        with id of invid and DatasetType with id of dstid and creating two new datafiles:

        dataset = {"name" : "ds1", "investigation" : { "id" : invid}, "type": {"id":dstid}}
        dataset["datafiles"] = [{"name" : "df1"}, {"name":"df2"}]
        entity = {"Dataset" : dataset}
        dsid = self.session.write(entity)[0]

        In all cases many to one relationships must already exist and so must
        be specified by their id value while one to many relationships cannot exist
        prior to the call and so the id value is omitted.

        For updating pass in the id of top level entity and the attributes you specify
        will be updated. In the case of a one to many relationship any new entities
        will be appended. So to add a Datafile to a Dataset one could write and at
        the same time updating the description field:

        dataset["id"] = dsid
        dataset["datafiles"] = [{"name" : "df3"}]
        dataset["description"] = "Indescribable"
        entity = {"Dataset" : dataset}
        self.session.write(entity)

        This will return an empty list because no new Dataset has been created and so
        this is regarded as an update. The similar operation:

        datafile = {"name" : "df3", dataset {"id" : dsid}}
        entity = {"Datafile" : datafile}
        dfid = self.session.write(entity)[0]

        also results in a Datafile being added to the Dataset but in this case it is
        treated as a creation and the id of the Datafile is returned. If it is wished to
        update the dataset description at the same time then one could write:

        entities = []
        datafile = {"name" : "df3", dataset {"id" : dsid}}
        entities.append({"Datafile" : datafile})
        dataset["id"] = dsid
        dataset["description"] = "Indescribable"
        entities.append({"Dataset" : dataset})
        dfid = self.session.write(entity)[0]

        where this time as list (an existing Dataset to be updated) and a Datafile to be created
        are passed in.
